  "sobre-historia": "<strong>Blindado</strong> is a character/nickname originally created by <span class=\"destaque\">Gustavo Berg</span> around mid-2018,\na time when Blindado played Fortnite regularly until 2022. In early 2022, Blindado discovered a growing trend:\na challenge where <span class=\"destaque\">Subway Surfers</span> players tried to play as long as possible without collecting coins.\nAt first, he found the idea interesting but wasn’t motivated to try it right away.\n<br><br>\nIn the following days, the challenge quickly grew in popularity, gaining worldwide attention.\nStill, Blindado continued to ignore it... until a Brazilian player, known as <span class=\"destaque\">bl4ckz_br</span>,\nachieved the world record for the first time.\n<br><br>\nUpon learning that a fellow countryman had reached the top, Blindado felt inspired. On July 26, 2022,\nhe decided to attempt the challenge for the first time. His first record was 2 minutes and 7 seconds,\nwhich already placed him officially among the world’s top 500 players.\n<br><br>\nFrom that moment on, Blindado became addicted to the challenge. Almost every week since then,\nhe managed to beat his own time, constantly improving and establishing himself as one of the leading names in the\nNo Coins community.",
